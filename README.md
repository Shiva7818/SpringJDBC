This repository contains code of SpringJDBC work.
Spring JDBC is part of the Spring Framework and provides a powerful mechanism for interacting with relational databases. 
It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps avoid common errors such as resource leaks, provides a consistent exception handling mechanism, and reduces boilerplate code.
